VBA projects (1997-1998 years)

VBA projects on visualization of geological data (geological columns displaying rocks in a well) in Microsoft Word and Excel.

The projects arose due to the need for beautiful data visualization in an era when there was no Internet, developed open source visualization tools. 
There were only Turbo Pascal, Microsoft Office. 
Turbo Pascal with pixel graphics could not give a beautiful high-resolution picture to insert into a Word document.
Therefore, only Word and Excel remained, since they had a built-in programming language 
that allowed automating the construction of beautiful geological illustrations.

Below is one of these pictures: geological column for the well
